QUESTION 1

By default are Django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

Answer :- Yes by default, Django signals are executed synchronously. This means that when a signal is triggered (e.g., post_save), the connected receiver function is executed immediately and in the same thread before the original process continues.

Steps :- 

1) Create a post_save signal for a Django model.

2) Inside the signal, we'll log the start and end times.

3) We'll also log the time just before and after the .save() call in the view.

4) The timestamps will show that the signal runs in between â€” confirming synchronous execution.

QUESTION 2

Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

Answer :- Yes, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller by default. This means when a signal is triggered (e.g., post_save), its receiver is executed in the same thread that triggered it â€” unless you explicitly run it in another thread or process.

Steps :- 

1) Log the current thread ID from both the view (caller) and the signal.

2) If both thread IDs match, the signal runs in the same thread.
